  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hey, I’m Siria and I’m a college student who also creates content
    on social media. I share my daily life on campus, study sessions, and
    realistic “what I actually eat” kinds of meals that you can make on
    a student budget.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started this website as a place where I could go a bit deeper than
    a short video or Instagram caption. Here you’ll find study tips,
    product recommendations, and simple recipes that fit into a busy
    student schedule.
  </p>

  <h3>What You’ll Find Here</h3>
  <ul class="list">
    <li><strong>Study essentials:</strong> tech, stationery and small things that make revision less painful.</li>
    <li><strong>Budget cooking:</strong> easy recipes and basic tools that work in tiny student kitchens.</li>
    <li><strong>Realistic routines:</strong> ideas for organising your time without pretending everything is perfect.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How I Choose Products</h3>
  <p>
    Whenever I talk about a product, it’s either something I already use
    or something I’ve researched for myself as a student. If there are
    affiliate links on a page, it means I may earn a small commission if
    you decide to buy through those links. This helps support my content
    and the time I spend testing and reviewing things, but it never changes
    the price for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to see more of my day-to-day student life, you can find me
    on Instagram at <_siriaalicata>.
