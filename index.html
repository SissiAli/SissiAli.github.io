      and simple recipes you can make on a student budget. Here I share the
      study tools and kitchen essentials that I genuinely find useful.

    <h2>Study & Tech Essentials for College</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      These are the kinds of tools that make long study sessions a bit easier:
      better focus, less neck pain, and fewer “my laptop is about to die” moments.

        <h3>Portable Laptop Stand for Library Sessions</h3>
        <p>
          A lightweight stand makes your laptop screen higher so you’re not
          hunched over for hours. It’s easy to fold, throw in your backpack,
          and set up on any library desk.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improves posture during long study sessions</li>
          <li>Folds flat and fits in most laptop sleeves</li>
          <li>Works with most 13&quot;–16&quot; laptops</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Noise-Cancelling / Isolation Headphones</h3>
        <p>
          Perfect for blocking out noisy roommates or busy study spaces.
          Even a budget pair can make a big difference when you’re trying
          to focus on lectures or revision.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Good for studying, commuting, and the gym</li>
          <li>Helps you stay in “deep focus” mode longer</li>
          <li>Some models double as a mic for online classes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Stationery Starter Pack</h3>
        <p>
          My go-to combo: a set of smooth pens, mild highlighters, sticky
          notes, and simple notebooks. Nothing fancy, just things that make
          note-taking clear and organised.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Different colours for different modules</li>
          <li>Sticky notes for reminders and quick formulas</li>
          <li>Works for both handwritten notes and printed slides</li>
        </ul>
